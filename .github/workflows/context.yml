# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ master ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
    - name: context
      # 환경변수 지정하기 COMMIT_ID = ${{ github.sha }} 이다라고 지정한거
      # name을 쓰기 위해서는 echo "id is $COMMIT_Id"를 하면 id 값을 출력할 수 있다.
      env: 
        COMMIT_ID: ${{ github.sha }}
      run: echo "commit id => $COMMIT_ID"
